Let's call this Working area as TG (Tiny-Gulp)

TG has some optional package like: 
    
    - browser-sync -> Reload the modified files and auto-reload browser pages.
    
    - gulp-nunjucks-render -> Improve your performance with HTML rendering
    
    - gulp-data -> need to manage global.json and improve to the MAX nunjunks
    
    - gulp-sourcemaps -> Provide you to have CSS/SCSS/LESS sourcemaps
    
    - gulp-uglify -> Let's minify source code


What is Tiny Gulp ? 

    This isn't only a tiny optimizer for your frontend works.
    This is tiny, clear and semi-complete 

TODO List:

    global.json MUST be tracked by watch and when modify browser-sync MUST reload properly 

What's next ?

    Introducing some custom template that you can download from branches. 
    Every folder will give you some html templates made by default page as equal as possible to Wordpress Layout, Magento Pages, Magento 2 Pages

    For an ecommerce like Magento i'll add : 
        - Product Page
        - Product lists Page
        - Default Standard Header
        - Default Footer
        - Checkout (with Mocha testing ???)
        - My Account (with Mocha testing ???) 

    I'll have fun!
